# Neural Netwrk with Numpy ONLY (No other package)

The aim of the study discussed in this report is to implement and train a multi-layer perceptron neural network on the provided training data set, and to test and evaluate the performance of this neural network on a hold-out testing data set. The implementation is using ***only standard numpy libraries and not any package.***

### Pre-Processing
1. One Hot Encoding
2. Normalizatin of input data

### Model
Techniques Used:
1. Weight intialisation
2. ReLU activation function
3. Weight decay
4. Momentum in stochastic gradient descent
5. Dropout
6. Softmax and cross-entropy loss
7. Mini-batch training
8. Batch normalisation
